Whenever we create object and there is condition based on it we create object, It is heavily used in company 

In factory pattern we create a factory and an inteface ex shape and diffent classes like circle, rectangle , and square will implement , factroy will be source of truth and bases on the input it will retrun the object

Factory Pattern Summary and Java Implementation
Key Learnings and Takeaways:
1. Factory Pattern Overview:

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
It helps avoid the need for explicit object creation by clients and provides a way to encapsulate the object creation logic.
2. Use Cases of Factory Pattern:

When you have multiple classes that share a common superclass, and you want to create objects of these classes based on some condition or configuration.
When you want to provide a way to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.
When you have a class with multiple subclasses and you want to hide the creation logic from the client.
3. Factory Pattern Implementation:

Create an interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for the objects to be created.
Create concrete classes that implement the interface or extend the abstract class.
Create a factory class that encapsulates the object creation logic and provides a method to create the objects based on some condition or configuration.
The client uses the factory class to create the objects instead of directly instantiating the concrete classes.
Java Code Implementation:

// Step 1: Create the interface/abstract class
```
public interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}
```
// Step 2: Create the concrete classes
```
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car...");
    }
}

public class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a motorcycle...");
    }
}
```

// Step 3: Create the factory class
```
public class VehicleFactory {
    public static Vehicle createVehicle(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("car")) {
            return new Car();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("motorcycle")) {
            return new Motorcycle();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid vehicle type");
        }
    }
}
```
// Step 4: Client code
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = VehicleFactory.createVehicle("car");
        car.drive(); // Output: Driving a car...

        Vehicle motorcycle = VehicleFactory.createVehicle("motorcycle");
        motorcycle.drive(); // Output: Driving a motorcycle...
    }
}
```
In this example, the VehicleFactory class encapsulates the object creation logic and provides a createVehicle() method to create the appropriate Vehicle object based on the input type. The client code uses the factory to create the desired Vehicle object without needing to know the specific implementation details.

-----------------------------------------------
Understanding and remembering the flow of implementing design patterns, such as the Abstract Factory Pattern, can indeed be challenging. Here are some tips and a structured approach to help you grasp and recall the process more easily:

Simplified Approach to Remembering the Flow
Identify the Need: Recognize when the pattern is applicable.
Abstract Definitions: Start by defining abstract concepts (interfaces).
Concrete Implementations: Implement these abstract concepts in concrete classes.
Factory Interface: Create a factory interface to produce families of related objects.
Concrete Factories: Implement the factory interface in concrete factory classes.
Client Usage: Use the factories in client code to create and use objects.
Mnemonic to Remember the Flow
Use the mnemonic "A-C-F-C-C":

Abstract Definitions
Concrete Implementations
Factory Interface
Concrete Factories
Client Usage
Simplified Example Using the Mnemonic
1. Abstract Definitions: Define abstract products.
java
```
public interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}

public interface VehicleEngine {
    void start();
}

```
2. Concrete Implementations: Implement the abstract products.
java
````
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car...");
    }
}

public class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a motorcycle...");
    }
}

public class CarEngine implements VehicleEngine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting car engine...");
    }
}

public class MotorcycleEngine implements VehicleEngine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting motorcycle engine...");
    }
}
```
3. Factory Interface: Define a factory interface to produce families of related objects.
```
public interface VehicleFactory {
    Vehicle createVehicle();
    VehicleEngine createEngine();
}
```
4. Concrete Factories: Implement the factory interface in concrete factory classes.
```
public class CarFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    public Vehicle createVehicle() {
        return new Car();
    }
    public VehicleEngine createEngine() {
        return new CarEngine();
    }
}

public class MotorcycleFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    public Vehicle createVehicle() {
        return new Motorcycle();
    }
    public VehicleEngine createEngine() {
        return new MotorcycleEngine();
    }
}
```
5. Client Usage: Use the factories in client code to create and use objects.
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory carFactory = new CarFactory();
        Vehicle car = carFactory.createVehicle();
        VehicleEngine carEngine = carFactory.createEngine();

        car.drive(); // Output: Driving a car...
        carEngine.start(); // Output: Starting car engine...

        VehicleFactory motorcycleFactory = new MotorcycleFactory();
        Vehicle motorcycle = motorcycleFactory.createVehicle();
        VehicleEngine motorcycleEngine = motorcycleFactory.createEngine();

        motorcycle.drive(); // Output: Driving a motorcycle...
        motorcycleEngine.start(); // Output: Starting motorcycle engine...
    }
}
```

##Breaking Down the Steps
Identify the Need: Use the Abstract Factory Pattern when you need to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Abstract Definitions: Define the common behaviors (interfaces) for the products you want to create.

Example: Vehicle and VehicleEngine interfaces.
Concrete Implementations: Implement the interfaces in concrete classes.

Example: Car and Motorcycle for Vehicle, CarEngine and MotorcycleEngine for VehicleEngine.
Factory Interface: Define a factory interface that includes methods to create the abstract products.

Example: VehicleFactory with methods createVehicle and createEngine.
Concrete Factories: Implement the factory interface in concrete factory classes.

Example: CarFactory and MotorcycleFactory.
Client Usage: Use the factory to create and use the products without knowing the concrete classes.

Example: Main class to demonstrate the use of CarFactory and MotorcycleFactory.
Visualization
Visualization can help remember the steps:

```
Abstract Definitions -> Concrete Implementations
     (Vehicle, VehicleEngine)        (Car, Motorcycle, CarEngine, MotorcycleEngine)
           \                              /
            \                            /
             \                          /
              \                        /
              Factory Interface    (VehicleFactory)
                   /                    \
                  /                      \
            Concrete Factories  (CarFactory, MotorcycleFactory)
                   /                     \
                  /                       \
           Client Usage                (Main)
```
By breaking down the steps, using a mnemonic, and visualizing the structure, you can better understand and remember the flow of the Abstract Factory Pattern implementation.


can you provide the same for factory pattern

Sure! Let's break down the Factory Pattern similarly to make it easier to understand and remember.

Factory Pattern Overview
The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Simplified Approach to Remembering the Flow
Identify the Need: Recognize when the pattern is applicable.
Abstract Definition: Start by defining an abstract concept (interface).
Concrete Implementations: Implement this abstract concept in concrete classes.
Factory Class: Create a factory class that encapsulates the object creation logic.
Client Usage: Use the factory class to create and use objects.
Mnemonic to Remember the Flow
Use the mnemonic "A-C-F-C":

Abstract Definition
Concrete Implementations
Factory Class
Client Usage
Simplified Example Using the Mnemonic
1. Abstract Definition: Define an abstract product.
```
public interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}
```
2. Concrete Implementations: Implement the abstract product.
```
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car...");
    }
}

public class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a motorcycle...");
    }
}
```
3. Factory Class: Create a factory class that encapsulates the object creation logic.
```
public class VehicleFactory {
    public static Vehicle createVehicle(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("car")) {
            return new Car();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("motorcycle")) {
            return new Motorcycle();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid vehicle type");
        }
    }
}
```
4. Client Usage: Use the factory class to create and use objects.
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = VehicleFactory.createVehicle("car");
        car.drive(); // Output: Driving a car...

        Vehicle motorcycle = VehicleFactory.createVehicle("motorcycle");
        motorcycle.drive(); // Output: Driving a motorcycle...
    }
}
```
Breaking Down the Steps
Identify the Need: Use the Factory Pattern when you need to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Abstract Definition: Define a common behavior (interface) for the product you want to create.

Example: Vehicle interface.
Concrete Implementations: Implement the interface in concrete classes.

Example: Car and Motorcycle for Vehicle.
Factory Class: Create a factory class that includes a method to create the product.

Example: VehicleFactory with method createVehicle.
Client Usage: Use the factory to create and use the product without knowing the specific class.

Example: Main class to demonstrate the use of VehicleFactory.

```
Abstract Definition -> Concrete Implementations
     (Vehicle)        (Car, Motorcycle)
           \               /
            \             /
             \           /
              \         /
              Factory Class    (VehicleFactory)
                    \                    /
                     \                  /
                      \                /
                   Client Usage     (Main)
```
Conclusion
By breaking down the steps, using a mnemonic, and visualizing the structure, you can better understand and remember the flow of the Factory Pattern implementation. The mnemonic "A-C-F-C" (Abstract Definition, Concrete Implementations, Factory Class, Client Usage) can help you recall the sequence of steps involved.
