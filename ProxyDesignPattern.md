# Proxy Design Pattern

### Example : Authentication, Caching , pre Processsing and Post Processing  

We can have multipe proxy handlers beteeen the client and server 

we can use it for logging, event handles , sometimew we need to publish event if anything is changed, centralized logging 


## Note : Spring boot also create proxy of the bean when we create a bean
